# Kirsh - Distributed ML Orchestrator (2025)

**Creator & Maintainer:** [fern4ndomartins](https://github.com/fern4ndomartins)  
**License:** Open Source  

Kirsh is a **modern C++ framework** for **distributed machine learning training orchestration**.  
The project was born from the idea of providing a **lightweight, efficient, and extensible** alternative for researchers, hobbyists, and developers who want to **extract maximum performance from small or mid-sized clusters**, without relying on complex enterprise-level solutions.  

Kirsh implements a **custom protocol** over **TCP sockets**, enabling high-performance communication between nodes, dynamic load balancing, and seamless integration with **popular ML frameworks via Python bindings**.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Modern C++ Core**  
  API designed with *templates*, *RAII*, and *move semantics* for maximum performance and memory safety.  

- **Custom Distributed Protocol**  
  Synchronization of gradients, checkpoints, and control messages over TCP, designed to minimize latency and overhead.  

- **Smart Dataset Partitioning**  
  Internal algorithms to balance dataset distribution dynamically, maximizing the use of each machineâ€™s resources.  

- **Python Bindings**  
  Direct usage of Kirsh inside projects that leverage PyTorch, TensorFlow, or other ML frameworks.  

- **Local-First Scalability**  
  Targeted at academic clusters, research labs, and home setups with multiple machines.
